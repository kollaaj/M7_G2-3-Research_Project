# Module 7 - Research project

In this assignment I was tasked to choose a subject according to my interests and I chose [GSAP, the GreenSock Animation Platform](https://greensock.com/gsap/). GSAP is the Swiss Army Knife of JavaScript animation... but better. Well, at least according to them. :grin:

## My Portfolio ish
I decided to create a portfolio of my school projects with various animations and horizontal scrolling. I learned a lot doing this project and if I were to do it again from scratch I feel I would do some things differently. For example, although I really like the idea of horizontal scrolling, I feel that it creates too many problems so I would not use it again, at least until I understand the implementation better.

The good thing about portfolio websites is that it is more of a creative expression rather than something that has strict UI/UX rules, and I can keep working on it for however long I want, although in the next iteration I will go less heavy on the visual patterns. :yum:

## Known Issues
- The font does not load unless locally installed
- Some SVG images are too big and have to be compressed
- Background parallax effect not working due to horizontal scrolling :poop:
